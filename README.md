# Huffman Coding
Huffman Coding is a algorithm for loss-less data compression. The algorithm works by creating a binary tree of nodes based on freqency counts of characters. The more occurences of a character there are, the smaller the code for the character is.

This algorithm is implemented using a priority queue.
